My name is Jean Leong, a Project Controller at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/my/) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Holding a Bachelorâ€™s Degree, I have completed a 7-month internship as a recruitment consultant prior to joining Huawei. 

I am also open to collaboration and training opportunities. My interests span across databases and recruiting, reflecting my professional background and aspirations.
